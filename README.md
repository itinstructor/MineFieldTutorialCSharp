# Visual C# MineField

This project started as a simple MineField game I wrote in Java in 2011. I ported it in 2016 to Visual C# as a game tutorial for a introductory C# programming class.

This version is built with Visual Studio Community 2019.

The Tutorial folder contains the tutorial in pdf format.
